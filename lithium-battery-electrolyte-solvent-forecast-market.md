Lithium battery electrolyte composition generally consists of lithium salt and organic solvent. The electrolyte used in lithium-ion batteries is an ionic conductor in which electrolyte lithium salt is dissolved in an organic solvent.

The organic solvent is the main part of the electrolyte and is closely related to the performance of the electrolyte. Generally, a high dielectric constant solvent and a low viscosity solvent are mixed for use. Commonly used solvents in lithium battery electrolyte are ethylene carbonate (EC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), etc. Generally, propylene carbonate (PC) is not used , Ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DME) and other solvents mainly used in lithium primary batteries.
