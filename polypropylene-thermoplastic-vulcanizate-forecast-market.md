A thermoplastic elastomer made from rubber and thermoplastic polyolefin by dynamic full curing of polypropylene with a curing agent. Because rubber particles (1~5 microns) maintain a reticular structure and exhibit elasticity at both room temperature and processing temperature, thermoplasticity and strength are provided by polyolefin, so their strength, elasticity and heat resistance are better than those of dynamic partially vulcanized thermoplastic polyolefin.
