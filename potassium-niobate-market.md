Report Overview:

Potassium Niobate(KNbO3) is aninorganic compoundwith the formula KNbO3. A colorless solid, it is classified as aperovskiteferroelectricmaterial. It exhibits nonlinear optical properties, and is a component of some lasers.[2]Nanowires of Potassium Niobate have been used to produce tunable coherent light.Potassium niobate can be used to prepare bismuth sodium titanate(BNT)-KN ceramics (BNT–KN ceramics) by the mixed oxide method. The addition of KN to the BNT system increases the dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the BNT-KN ceramics. These properties of the ceramic system are suitable for the development of lead-free capacitors. Cu dopped KNbO3 single crystals also found application in semiconductor laser technology because Cu doping resulted in electronic states with near-infrared absorption bands.
